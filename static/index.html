	<i>Art & Technology Enthusiast</i><br>
	“I aspire to inspire before I expire” <br>
	Northern California native exploring Southern California and beyond.
    
	<p> Art has always been one of my strongest passions, so here I am now! I am currently studying Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts (with a minor in Computer Science) at the University of California, San Diego.</P>
    <p> I am fluent in traditional art (as in drawing, painting, etc.), but I am currently expanding my skill set towards technological areas (such as programming and 3D modeling). It’s a continuous growth of creativity and exploration of the endless possibilities of art. Find out the specifics of my drive by peeking at my <a href="artiststatement.html">artist statement</a> and discover the types of work I do by navigating the "Projects" down below and my <a href="http://crystalmnguyen.wix.com/arts">online art portfolio</a>! Ideally, at the end of the day, I am just aiming to reach out to someone with my work. </p>

			<b>FitKit</b>
			<p> FitKit is an all-in-one health application developed for the Android platform utilizing Android Studio and Parse. It is an app that keeps track of the user's basic health profile, BMI, and daily calories. Using this information, it provides tips on how to work towards a better and healthier lifestyle.
			<br><br>
			FitKit was designed and developed in a Software Engineering course at UCSD. Using Agile methodology, our team of 5 implemented FitKit with weekly iterations involving gathering requirements, designing, coding, and testing. As a team, we had many standup meetings and met with customers weekly to gather feedback, and to create new user stories.</p></td> </tr>

			<b>Draw On Kim</b>
			<p> This project began from a silly midterm project. I was just familiarizing myself with Android Studio, an development tool, and started off with a tutorial for a drawing app. But seeing as that wasn’t unique and being limited on time, Kim Kardashian somehow made an appearance and became the spotlight of my app. The concept of “Draw On Kim” definitely evolved after in-class critiques and I ended up added more functions to the app to make it more complete. Users now have a lot more choices- such as the ability to choose different Kim’s to draw on, and the addition of the Kanye face stamp which allows Kanye to assert his presence with Kim (like how it is in real life). 
			<br><br>
			This app may not serve to be as useful as some other apps that exist, but it does provide entertainment and I would consider it a novelty app commenting on culture that exists in the present. I play with the ideas surround Kim Kardashian, Kanye, and ultimately “Kimye” because these figures play such a big role in our lives today. This app clearly reflects the mainstream media and the current age we live in, especially as I impose Kanye into my original “just-Kim” app and the fact that I actually made an app revolving around Kim and Kayne (not that there haven’t been popular apps about them already). I find it to be a fun and an adequate representation of the world we live in now (like if someone was to discover this app centuries later, they would be able to understand certain aspects of lives).
