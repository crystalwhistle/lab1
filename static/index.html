<br>
	<p> Art has always been one of my strongest passions, so here I am now! I am currently studying Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts (with a minor in Computer Science) at the University of California, San Diego.</P>
 <br>
    <p> I am fluent in traditional art (as in drawing, painting, etc.), but I am currently expanding my skill set towards technological areas (such as programming and 3D modeling). It’s a continuous growth of creativity and exploration of the endless possibilities of art. Find out the specifics of my drive by peeking at my artist statement and discover the types of work I do by navigating the "WORKS" tab in the menu. Ideally, at the end of the day, I am just aiming to reach out to someone with my work. </p>
